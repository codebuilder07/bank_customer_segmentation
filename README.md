# Bank Customer Segmentation
Banking Customer Segmentation

![Project Description](https://github.com/codebuilder07/bank_customer_segmentation/blob/bbc08eeae387590096487a85a4b2ccacd57369e5/project%20description.png)

This project aims to segment bank customers into distinct groups based on geographical location and other relevant features. By grouping customers, the bank can tailor marketing strategies, understand customer behavior better, and provide targeted services to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

Project Overview
This segmentation is achieved through a combination of data cleaning and clustering techniques. Using unsupervised learning, we identified clusters of customers that share similar characteristics, focusing on geography as a primary attribute.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning:

Missing Values: Handled any missing data entries.
Data Standardization: Standardized numerical data to ensure consistency.
Categorical Encoding: Converted categorical variables (like geographical region) into a machine-readable format.
Feature Engineering:

Selected and engineered relevant features to improve clustering results.
Clustering:

K-Means Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering on the cleaned and preprocessed data, testing various numbers of clusters to identify the optimal segmentation.
Geographical Segmentation: Focused on geographical regions as a primary factor for segmenting customers.
Evaluation:

Inertia Plot: Used an elbow plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzed clusters to understand the composition of each customer segment.
Results
Through clustering, we identified key segments based on geography and other behavioral attributes. These segments can be leveraged for targeted marketing, personalized banking services, and better customer relationship management.

Visualizations

Above: Visualization of customer segments based on geographic clustering.

Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and clustering.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.
scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing cluster results.
Future Improvements
Refinement of Clusters: Test with additional clustering methods like hierarchical clustering.
Feature Expansion: Incorporate more features such as transaction history or customer satisfaction scores for a more nuanced segmentation.
